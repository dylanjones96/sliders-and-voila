# Using Voilà to render interactive slider plots 

## Notes on implementation
- This repository was copied from https://github.com/binder-examples/voila. Changes have been made. The index.ipynb notebook was used as a template. 
- Currently, every time a slider value is changed the instance of the figure window is cleared, a new figure is created, then the new lines are drawn. in addition to formatting of the figure (adding axes labels etc.). It would probaly be more efficient to link the update function to the lines belonging to the figure object, but I couldn't get that to work (although honestly I didn't try that hard). 
- Also, Matplotlib is used to draw the figures. The main drawback here is that Matplotlib figures are not types of ipython widgets. Instead, the matplotlib figure object is embedded within a widgets Box. I _think_ this can make integration with other ipython widgets tricky, especially when it comes to scaling/resizing. There exist potential alternatives that seem to have higher resolution and look 'cleaner'. These are
   - bqplot: the figure objects in this library are themselves widgets and would be the optimal choice, but it seems (to me at least) that one can't write maths symbols or provide a list of custom tick labels to axes locations,
   - ipympl: using %matplotlib widget magic command to turn matplotib figure into interactive one works, but when the figure object is redrawn in the current implementation the effect is quite jarring.

## Some instructions lifted from host repository README

If you would like to use the same configuration as this repository but for another project, check out the following steps:

1. Make sure the repository is publicly available (on GitHub, Gitlab or as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com)
2. Define the dependencies in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml). `requirements.txt` is also supported. In the dependency file, add `voila`.
3. Go to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) and enter the URL of the repository.
4. In `Path to a notebook file`, select `URL` and use the Voilà endpoint: `voila/render/path/to/notebook.ipynb`
5. Click `Launch`.
6. Binder will trigger a new build if this is the first launch (or if there have been new changes since
   the last build). This might take a few minutes to complete. If an image is already available,
   the server will be able to start within a few seconds.

Here is an overview of the Binder configuration on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org):
